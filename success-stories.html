<strong>Zin Thu Minn, March 2016</strong>

<img class="alignleft" style="text-align: left; width: 25%; padding-right: 15px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Zin-Thu-Minn.jpg" alt="Zin Thu Minn" />I came from Myanmar in June 2013. I was in Australia for 9 months and got a full time job for only 2 months when I joined the Real Wealth Australia Mentoring program (Mar 2014). My husband had a full time job and had saving $40k and we had no equity at all. After 9 months (Dec 2014) we bought our first investment property in QLD through the mentoring of the Real Wealth Australia Mentoring team. They taught us how to do Due Diligence to choose growth suburb to build up equity and he advised us to choose a property with rental yield above 5.5% to cover expenses by rental income. Jan 2016, we bought our second property (cash flow property) in VIC which has 2 titles (one is a house with land and another is a land only) with our saving money. Now our first property has equity 50k and we'll use it to build a removal house on the land in coming Apr 2016 and it will be our third property. 

Thank you for simple and step by step instructions which are really helpful to a person like me who come from a third world country.

<pullquote>Two properties in 12 months</pullquote>

I bought a QLD property with my Self Managed Super Fund (SMSF) leveraging off the learning I accumulated through the Real Wealth Australia Property Mentoring Program. I purchased my principal property of residence just one month earlier! This latest acquisition is positively geared. 12 months earlier I had no properties and was struggling to save for my first property with my (then) partner. Two properties in 12 months has left me pretty chuffed.

Using the Modules and Systems from the Real Wealth Australia 10 properties in 10 years Mentoring Program we bought another house, will most likely subdivide and leverage the position to get a positive cashflow position.

We joined the Real Wealth Australia 10 Properties in 10 Years mentoring program 6 months ago. It took us some time to get through the material, but once we understood the principles Real Wealth Australia was teaching us, investing in property took on a whole new meaning. 

We were able to objectively look at deals and evaluate them based on our strategy and under the guidance of the Property Mentors we were able to purchase our second property with confidence.

I quickly learned that they are usually not the ideal choice for property investing. 

Luckily for me I purchased in a small development (less than 30). The Due Diligence also showed the quality of the fittings was better than most other developments in the area. 

My property investing journey is on it's way and I look forward to many more future purchases armed with the sound knowledge I am gaining.

<strong>Stephen Caltabiano, February 2016</strong>

<img class="alignleft" style="text-align: left; width: 25%; padding-right: 15px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Stephen-Caltabiano.jpg" alt="Stephen" />I started the real wealth education program a little over 12 months ago. At the time we had one investment property and were looking to purchase further properties, with a view to establishing a passive income base eventually. 

However we lacked direction in many areas of property investment. We found it difficult to decide which properties were right for us to buy. What type of properties (houses or units), what areas would be liable to bring better returns, whether to buy newer or older properties and the resulting tax implications. We also found it very difficult to understand the importance of different buying entities and their long term implications. Consequently, we found ourselves wasting a lot of time and not really getting to the stage of really making any decisions. 

Involvement in the real wealth program has allowed us to move forward with a greater level of confidence. We have now purchased a set of 3 units on one title in a trust, which has been set up for the purpose. This property is a positive cash flow arrangement, and has allowed us to move forward to purchase a second set of 4 units on separate titles, which are also cash flow positive, and with some work could actually generate a reasonable capital return also. 

The plan is to now look to areas to purchase one or two new or very new houses this year with good capital growth potential, although with negative cash flow. (with tax benefits these should still be close to positively geared) This will be possible because of the cash flow generated by the other properties. 

Although we have been involved in property for a long time, many of the concepts we have come to understand through our involvement with Real Wealth are still relatively new to us. However, the access to information which allows us to make intelligent decisions on property purchases, rather than just what we think might be a good idea, and the help of Real Wealth mentors along the way has given us the confidence to actually move forward. Thanks for your help!

<pullquote>My first investment property</pullquote>

Before this purchase my situation was .... I had no property when I joined the Real Wealth Australia mentoring program and I rent where I live in Sydney. I had $100,000 savings, but only a small amount of Superannuation having been a single Mum for some time. But I didn't have enough to buy a home for us in Sydney and I worried about how I'll be able to afford to live when I retire.
Real Wealth helped me learn how to make my money work better for me, and take steps towards being better prepared for retirement.
The results I now have achieved is.... I now have my first investment property, and a better understanding of what I need to do to next to get my second investment property, and ultimately to better look after myself and my family.

We had 1 investment properties before starting the 10 Properties in 10 Years Mentoring Program with Real Wealth Australia. We had no idea of how and where to start the next one until we joined the program. From doing the strategy, budget, finance, due diligence to finalising the suburb and the property, it was a slow experience but we were glad that we have put what we learn to good use. Hopefully we can start the next one soon and put all the learning to good use again.

<pullquote>A wonderful result</pullquote>

The Real Wealth Australia team worked hard on getting this one across the line over the Christmas break. I had not finished what I need to do, in the program meaning I read the 57 biggest mistakes but not the step by step program that real wealth advises to complete before purchasing.

This was not at all a brick wall for the Real Wealth Australia mentoring team they all just looked at this as a challenge and helped me achieve a wonderful result, I'm very grateful of the support and great advice that I'm receiving and I'm looking forward to my next buy, I cannot sing the praise and professionalism enough that this team possess.

Thank you real wealth Australia I look forward to the great journey with your team.

<pullquote>$1.2million portfolio in 5 months</pullquote>

I decided to sell an investment property 6 months ago to use the equity to begin my journey.

Real Wealth Australia guided me with their amazing support from their mentors to setting up a great team for finance and management of properties. 

The result I now have purchased 3 properties ($1.2million portfolio in 5 months) and I am only 2 properties away from setting my 12 month goal of purchasing 5 properties. I would have never achieved this had it not been for me joining the 10 properties in 10 years mentoring program team. 

Best decision I ever made!

<pullquote>A second dwelling</pullquote>

I got started on the Real Wealth Australia Mentoring Program with a purchase of a 4-bedroom house on 680 m2 block purchased within our SMSF - mid 2015. Purchase price $306,000 and currently renting at $330 per week. Mike Wegener very helpful and assisted us with setting up the SMSF and obtaining the loan. 

The latest result of my participation in the Real Wealth Australia 10 Properties in 10 years is I have purchased an existing house on 900 m2 block. This was purchased with a view to building a second dwelling (3bedroom house) at the back of the block. Existing property purchased at $220,000 and is now tenanted and renting at $290 per week.

I recently purchased 3 properties in quick succession after joining the Real Wealth Australia 10 Properties in 10 Years mentoring program. One is a 1900 property which has had a total renovation in the last year, in an area that is going through a growth/development and is in a sought after area for rent. 
I also purchased a property in WA which after completing due diligence the property matched my buying rules. 
Based on the same due diligence for WA I purchased a second property (in my SMSF)

<strong>Michael Routh, January 2016</strong>

<img class="alignleft" style="text-align: left; width: 25%; padding-right: 15px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Michael-Routh.jpg" alt="Michael" />Well, after 7...yep SEVEN extensions, 3 trips to Australian embassies in Japan (where I live and work as an expat) and Korea to get documents certified and countless disappointments and setbacks...I FINALLY settled the property. Thanks to very helpful guidance from the Real Wealth Australia mentoring team, I not only was turned away from two potentially poor areas to invest in, but the mentors also gave me the confidence to know that I was buying a quality investment property that fit my specific buying rules. 

I am very happy with my first property and have improved my investing knowledge greatly going through the Real Wealth Australia 10 in 10 course. The material is thorough and easy to follow and the mentors have been great. Thanks to the finance expert too who shared my daily settlement frustrations with me also. 

I feel this tough first experience has made me stronger and wiser and I’m already looking forward to the next one with the lessons learnt from this experience to fall back on.... back to budgeting, saving and continuing to increase my property investment IQ. As they say 'the first million (or first property) is always the hardest'

<pullquote>Just purchased 2 properties within a space of weeks</pullquote>

After purchasing a couple of properties we found ourselves in a state of “what next?” We knew we had to purchase more and had property investing goals but we were not sure how to take the next step and what direction to go. 
After joining Real Wealth Australia’s Mentoring Program, we have not only found our spark and drive again but we have just purchased 2 properties within a space of weeks with settlement in 2 states at the same time (giving our broker a few sleepless nights I suspect) if it wasn't for Helen and her team of experts we would probably still be pondering what we should do. 
Our goals are now focused and clear although our short term goal of 3 prior to Christmas fell short we are now looking forward to getting another 3 minimum in 2016 and we will then look and adjust our goals moving forward.
Helen thanks to you and your team for getting us back on track!

<pullquote>I have found the checklists invaluable</pullquote>

<img class=" alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Jill-Clarke.jpg" alt="" width="50%"/>We were renting our PPOR and running our business from the same premises, but had accumulated several investment properties.
Circumstances dictated that we needed to move - it was difficult to decide whether to buy a PPOR or continue to rent and buy more investment properties.
With the Real Wealth Australia mentoring program, we were able to clearly map out our way forward. As it turned out, we bought a PPOR and rented some Commercial Space for the business. Much better for work /life balance too!
Although we were already underway on our property investment journey, we now have a great system to inform our decision making process which was probably a bit haphazard previously.
We are consolidating our position and plan to renovate/improve a couple of existing properties to create some more equity and then we will be buying again (with a clear buying strategy!).

<strong>Bret and Donna Ireland, December 2015</strong>

<img class="alignleft" style="text-align: left; width: 25%; padding-right: 15px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bret-Ireland.jpg" alt="Bret" />Since joining the Real Wealth Australia Mentoring Program we have implemented the processes as stipulated in the training (ie budget, borrowing power, goals and strategy).

We are currently in the process of building a triplex and we anticipate it will be completed by the end of February 2016. Valuations have indicated that the completed price of each unit will be $400000. We entered into a fixed price turnkey contract of $315,000 per unit (incl land) I believe the instant equity taking into account interest will be around $70,000 per unit. We have received rent appraisals on each of the units ranging from $400 - $430 per week. Strategy: Buy and Hold - positively geared.

We have also had a property built in North Qld for which we paid $415,000 and was valued by the bank upon completion at $477,000. Unfortunately, prices have slipped with the opening of an estate nearby to $400,000. The rent on the property have also slid from $470 per week to $420 per week. This property has gone from being line ball cash flow positive to cash flow negative. We built the property as a medium term investment and see the adjustment in price as a short term hick-up. Strategy - Buy and hold (for the time being) - negatively geared.

In September of this year we purchased a duplex for our two sons. We have always had the view that we would help them to gain a foothold in the market when the opportunity arose. Upon purchase the duplex were not strata-titled and were purchased for $660,000. A rental appraisal indicated the rental per week on each unit would be $410. As it turns out each of our sons now live in a unit each. We believe the cost of strata titling will be approximately $10,000 in total and should increase the market value of each unit to $350000. Once the strata titling is completed our sons will have the units revalued and should be able to pay back some of the equity we have invested enabling us to reinvest in another property. Strategy Buy and Hold - Parental help to our sons.

<pullquote>An exciting experience</pullquote>

<img class=" alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Peter-Keegan.jpg" alt="" width="50%"/> I joined Real Wealth Australia in July 2015 this year and settled my first property on the 8th October 2015. The property is positively geared and under Strata Title. A little nerve racking at times but overall an exciting experience. Thanks to the Property Mentoring team at Real Wealth Australia for their help and guidance. Am looking forward to 2016 for a second and hopefully third investment. Have been a bit quiet of late but all is good now. Budgeting is still a bit foreign to me but am getting a handle on it.

<pullquote>The confidence we gained from the support of the mentors is priceless</pullquote>

This is our first investment property and I can confidently shout out loud that without the help of the Real Wealth Australian mentors, we would never have been able to achieve this goal properly and strategically. Now, we are excited to purchase our second property and the confidence we gained from the support of the mentors is priceless. It also helped me to start to understand the importance of a structured system in achieving goals. Now I am also starting to build my business with the concept and logic that Real Wealth Australia passed on to me. It is so exciting to be on the learning journey and also accumulating wealth at the same time. 
Special thanks to Karen and Nick, my favourite RWA mentors.

<pullquote>I discovered there is a lot to learn</pullquote>

This is our first investment property purchase since joining the Real Wealth Australia 10 Properties in 10 years Menotoring program last year. During the process of purchasing I discovered there is a lot to learn along the way, dealing with all sorts of people. Some good and some to be wary of. You need to know how to get the information to check if everything stacks up for the deal very quickly as there are other people that are doing the same for that property and if you don't, it may be gone before you know it. Make sure you do your due diligence before you buy and always ask the questions you feel you need to ask, no matter how silly you think they may be.

I can't imagine that I came from an under-developed country and now I have two investment properties by saving my salary.

Doing well managed budgeting, picking the right property, asking the right people to do the right job. This thing can't happen smoothly like it is if I don't have Real Wealth Australia to perfectly support myself.

Especially a BIG THANK YOU and hug to Nick Farrow, Marjo Young, Karen Van Maanen and Helen Collier-Kogtevs. If I didn’t join the mentoring program in Sept 2014 I would have spent all money with unfulfilled holiday plan, or got lost with many mining shares purchase, or unfinished online shopping and so on.

When the spirit of investor kicked in, my high determination will push me to do everything to get investment properties.(the correct way)

Oops I forgot to say “Thank you Cheryl Bedford.” She is a key person to start me with an action call.

<pullquote>A solid result from my investing experience</pullquote>

A solid result from my investing experience with Real Wealth Australia mentoring program.

I purchased a 4 bedroom home in Morayfield QLD for $295k, under the median price of $349k. The property is currently tenanted with a rental yield at 6.08%. This property includes instant equity, cash flow positive, with 9% p.a growth forecast from Residex. The property is 7 years old with decent amount of depreciation remaining.

We have had an interest in property for over 10 years, we have built, renovated and rented several properties but never really knew if what we had done was structured right. We finally joined Real Wealth Australia just over 12 months ago after reading a couple of Helen's books. 

The course has really given us so much more knowledge and understanding on how to build our portfolio. All the Real Wealth Australia mentoring team have been really supportive and easy to communicate with.

<strong>Sweemee Mei, September 2015</strong>

<img class="alignleft" style="text-align: left; width: 25%; padding-right: 15px;" src="http://www.realwealthaustralia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Swemee.png" alt="Sweemee" />It is a wonderful program and I am so grateful that I have found a true mentoring program which is practical, easy to follow and having support from mentors. With the help from number cruncher and wealth builder software, it gives me a clearer picture and no guessing numbers when we need to purchase the investment property. 

The Real Wealth Australia software is so powerful and helpful and I believe every investor should have a go with it. Also the mentors are really humble and genuine in providing advice and guidance.

Overall I am very satisfied with the mentoring program. I particularly enjoy and appreciate that participants are free to ask questions and the most important part is that educators are very humble, patient and willing to help and clarify any doubts. As the  Real Wealth Australia masterclass is an intensive learning journey in 2 days, I found that it will be best that participants can go through the materials first so one can have a better understanding towards the learning. 

After the masterclass, I am CONVERTED and starting to have a clearer mindset about property investing. It’s not only building wealth, it is also about lowering risk, being able to focus on goals and be disciplined towards the entire journey.

<pullquote>I got to hear scenarios and questions that I wouldn’t think of.</pullquote>

Being part of the Real Wealth Australia bootcamp I got to hear scenarios and questions that I wouldn’t think of. The presenters were excellent and were able to answer questions and it was very clear they knew what they were talking about, building my confidence.  The Strategy and Due Diligence I found excellent as this is where I am at in the program.  I am starting to improve my understanding of property investing.  The clear processes implemented in the program helps me understand the steps.  It is helping me to build my confidence in purchasing and the mentors have great knowledge.

Attending the Masterclass helped me fine tune and learn more about the processors already gone through.  It helped me to understand the concept and how to do it practically.  Cleared most of the grey areas.  Amazing to hang around with like-minded people and networking. Learn the process.  Clear out a lot of doubts. 

Participating in a great program like the 10 Properties in 10 Years mentoring gives the full potential to buy better investment property on your own.  Also to repeat the process again and again until you reach the goal.

I only pay rent on my unit of about $135/week. I live by myself so I have heaps of money left over. Previously I spent my money on too many holidays, too many surf boards and unnecessary expenses! BUT....after I met Real Wealth Australia, I aim to have 10 properties in 10 years. I stopped paying for my entertainment &amp; started to cook food for the whole week even bringing food to work!

I hardly ever to go a restaurant! I can save heaps of money this way to put towards my 10% deposit.

And I didn't feel like I was deprived of my holidays or even my happiness because I feel very happy to see my money growing into the right direction!

I've been in program since SEP 2014 and I have just brought a cash flow property with $130 / week left over after paying interest to the bank! How wonderful it is! And I’m not going to go on holiday anymore until I can be financially independent.

All of you at Real Wealth are very helpful team to support me.

I would just like to say that you have a well-developed strategy that keeps everyone on their toes.
 
For my part, I am encouraged and feel motivated each time I receive your email with the positive attitude like this.
 
Since the bootcamp seminar nearly two weeks ago, I have been very busy with some urgent matters, but now I can concentrate on the preparation on my business tax return before I can send to my accountant to discuss about increasing yearly income for the last financial year which is the only key for my strategy.

But people like Karen Van Maanen are proof that you can be very short on both and still succeed. The only thing that really matters is being high on determination. Not only do I own a portfolio of 11 properties and counting, but I also work tremendously hard. In fact, for almost seven years I have worked a full-time job and a second permanent part-time job four nights a week to achieve what others told me I could never do alone.

Not only does Karen own a portfolio of 11 properties and counting, but she also works tremendously hard. In fact, for almost seven years Karen has worked a full-time job and a second permanent part-time job four nights a week to achieve what others told her she could never do alone. 

These days, Karen has one crucial piece of advice for investors: even though it’s important to invest as soon as possible, it is also critical to educate yourself first. 

“I winged it through the first few purchases with my ex, and we did OK, but the power of education and knowing upfront what can be achieved and having a firm plan in place is crucial,” says Karen.

Real Wealth helped us through the process, keeping me on track when I questioned my decisions and being there to bounce off whenever needed.

The results now have us with our first investment property which is neutrally geared which is a relief considering we receive no tax benefits from being a non-resident for taxation purposes. Furthermore, we are in a situation to commence research into a second property within 3 months.

<strong><em>Jana and Andrew Houston, 2015</em></strong>

<img class=" wp-image-28111 alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Jane-and-Andrew-Houston-225x300.jpg" alt="Jane-and-Andrew-Houston" width="198" height="264" />It has taken approximately a year since we began the <a href="http://www.realwealthaustralia.com/"><b>Real Wealth Australia</b></a> Course for Andrew and I to take our first investing step.After reading the course content from our Haul Trucks in the Western Australian Pilbara we finally decided on an investing plan and took action. After months of Due Diligence we went unconditional on a block of 5 Flats.In short, the current valuation came up $89,000 above our purchase price and once we title them individually we will have close to $200,000 above purchase price to play with for another investment which we hope to access through a re-evaluation in 6-8 months’ time. The current rents achieve a 10% yield.We would just like to say a big thank you to the team at Real Wealth as there is no way we would have achieved such an exceptional outcome.

<strong>Marcelo and Louise Lecuna, 2015</strong>

Working with industry experts at Real Wealth Australia we have gained confidence again in our decision of choosing property as our investment vehicle. We have the right tools to make great decisions when investing in the right property for our situation and circumstances.

The knowledge gained is invaluable. After doing some other property education programs which resulted in poor decisions, we were concerned that we would get more of the same advice but this has in no way been the case. The knowledge of the Real Wealth team is miles above that of our previous experiences. Thank you, Real Wealth Australia.

We can be a step ahead of bad decisions by using the information and educational material. The wall of fear is not as frightening as it was 6 months ago. My knowledge has elevated and this empowers and nurtures confidence in an activity that is becoming less mysterious and untouchable.

<strong>Tanya Devoy, 2015</strong>

Like a lot of people I had no investment properties, but we did have savings and equity in our home. I had purchased investment properties before, but only in Sydney. 

Real Wealth Australia really supported and educated me in making informed decisions.

They helped me choose the right suburb. By following their system I have a strategy. I have purchased two properties within 6 months of joining, and now in negotiation for our third. Talking to the Mentors have helped enormously.

I have purchased this property as my Principal Place of residence. I owed $700,000 on my PPOR before this and I realised that I was never going to be able to support multiple properties with this much debt that generated no income. So what I did was to propose a joint venture with my parents.

We bought this new place together, and are in the process of building a second dwelling on the property (it is 25 acres) and at the end of the process will be debt free. This will allow me to use my entire borrowing power to build my portfolio.

When I started the Real Wealth Australia Mentoring Program, I had $50,000 in credit card debt. Within a very short space of time I have reeled in my debt back to $10,000 with a further reduction to $5,000 planned in the next month!

I signed a contract for an off the plan property in Gladstone prior to joining the program. As certain details of the property didn’t stack up, I withdrew my offer and found it later sold for $45,000 less.

<strong>Ash Coburn, 2012</strong>

 My name is Ash Coburn. I began the 2012 Mentoring program a couple of months back and I am pleased to say I am thoroughly enjoying the program. In particular, I am pleased with the content and the way in which you and the Real Wealth Australia team deliver the education in a down to earth way (It’s a breath of fresh air after the several ‘spruiking’ education programs I have attended).

I have been educating myself in property investing for about two years’ now. Earlier this year, my fiancé and I bought our first PPOR, and we recently settled on two blocks of land in Gisborne, Vic (which took over 2 years to develop due to council red tape) and unfortunately in that time the supply/demand situation was reversed along with market sentiment, eliminating the $60,000 capital growth we had achieved via stage releases. I am currently applying for construction finance to build on both simultaneously. Thanks to Real Wealth Australia, I have been able to think a bit more creatively and plan to sell off one after completion and pay down the other. Achieving a 57% LVR and a Net Return of 8.5% with an average growth over 10 years of 7 %, the land purchases I bought in an area close to friends & family suddenly seem like a good property for the portfolio.

Once again I’d like to thank you and Real Wealth Australia as I feel you have provided me with the ever so obvious need to have the correct strategy and buying rules in place before I go out and buy!

<pullquote>Their passion is inspiring</pullquote>

Helen and Ed have given us the knowledge, and through this, the confidence to take our investing to a new level with goals and a strategy that we are turning into a reality. More than this though, Helen and Ed have been very encouraging and engaging in their teaching and presenting and their passion is inspiring. We would never have acquired the skills, tools and confidence had we not enrolled in their program.

We are thrilled to have already purchased two properties this year with plenty to look forward to. 

The amazing panel of experts and great networking have allowed us to grow as much as we have so far. Being part of a group of like-minded people is inspiring in itself away from the often negative attitudes from peers and family.

<pullquote>These guys really want your investment efforts to work</pullquote>

The Real Wealth Property Mentoring Program was true education based upon real life experiences – the best you can base your learning upon.,

Many aspects of investing were covered in depth and many professional contacts were then made available to those being mentored – this is probably the most important experience I realised. These guys really want your investment efforts to work and they are prepared to get you the help that you need to fill the gap or fear being experienced.

They are the real deal and my money has been well spent at last!!!

<pullquote>Second investment property with no money down</pullquote>

I stumbled upon "Real Wealth Australia" at the Property Expo with Helen there in person. We spoke for no more than 10 minutes, but the phrase "when the student is ready the teacher will appear!" came up and I got myself short listed for the next 12 month mentoring program.

The following 6 months were just amazing. The course is rich in content. Helen and Ed's approach uses mistakes and wins that they made in the past as learning examples which made it real (banter included for free). The course materials include templates for due diligence, and statements and clauses for making offers and buying property. Throughout the program, access to the mentors is always just a phone call away.

So the results… I secured my second investment property with no money down within months of starting the course!

<pullquote>Made an offer on our first house</pullquote>

The course helped us create our own map and take our own steps. During the course we made an offer on our first house. We did this with confidence and with knowledge. Amazingly, the real estate agents were forced to deal with us more carefully, more respectfully and more seriously. So the deals we are looking at are much better in terms of purchase price, growth potential and so on.

We’ve become investors. We’re already better and we know we’ll safely and confidently learn. We will achieve our goals.

<pullquote>Exceeded my expectations</pullquote>

I have to say that your program has exceeded my expectations!

At the start of the program l did question whether my investment in the course was going to be worth it. I must say after the first session of the workshop, l was totally convinced the answer was yes! Helen and Ed are two extremely genuine people who want success for their clients. They lead by example and make clients feel at ease while providing all the support possible. It is not rocket science what Helen and Ed teach, however, it is presented in such a way that takes all the stress/indecision out of the investing process. The program structure/content of the course is fantastic, and blended in with real life examples, really delivers the message that financial freedom through property investing is possible!

I highly recommend the program to novice investors as well as those with experience.

We loved doing the course. Great to be surrounded with like minded people enthusiastic about property but all coming from different situations. Helen and Ed are very knowledgeable and approachable. The course really places importance on various aspects of property including due diligence, selection, acquisition and property management. It places important emphasis on certain things like depreciation reports, valuers etc… which may not seem that important from just reading books. The course acts as a catalyst to start “doing”, not just reading books and magazines. We are extremely pleased we enrolled and look forward to a great future in property investing and a continued relationship with Helen and Ed as wonderful mentors. Thank you so much.
